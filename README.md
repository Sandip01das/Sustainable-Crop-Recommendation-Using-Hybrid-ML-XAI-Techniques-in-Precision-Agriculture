# Sustainable Crop Recommendation Using Hybrid ML-XAI Techniques in Precision Agriculture üå±

This repository presents a Smart Crop Recommendation System that integrates Machine Learning (ML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for sustainable and precision-driven agriculture. By combining robust ML models with model-agnostic interpretability techniques, this project aims to assist farmers, agronomists, and agricultural planners in making accurate, data-driven crop choices‚Äîespecially critical under changing climatic conditions.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Hybrid ML-XAI Model**: Combines supervised ML algorithms with Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) for interpretability.
- **Feature Reduction**: Input features reduced from 22 to 7 without compromising accuracy.
- **High Accuracy**: Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (GNB) model achieved 99.55% accuracy on test data.
- **Web App Deployment**: A Flask-based web interface that provides real-time crop recommendations with visual explanations.
- **Explainability First**: Integrates interpretable outputs to foster trust among non-technical users.

## üìå Problem Statement

Traditional crop selection relies heavily on intuition, past experience, or limited agronomic advice. This often results in:

- Suboptimal yields
- Inefficient resource use
- Economic losses for farmers

The proposed Smart Crop Recommendation System (SCRS) overcomes these limitations by using data-driven decisions with transparent, explainable logic.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle Smart Farming Data 2024 (SF24)
- **Records**: 2,200 instances
- **Features**: 22 soil, climate, and agricultural parameters including:
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium
  - Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity
  - pH, Soil Moisture, Sunlight, Wind Speed
  - Fertilizer Use, Pest Pressure, Irrigation Frequency

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Label encoding, Min-Max normalization, and train-test split (80/20).
2. **XAI Feature Selection**:
   - Used **Permutation Feature Importance** to select top 7 impactful features.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Six classifiers: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, SVC, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
   - Performance compared with and without feature selection.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
5. **Deployment**:
   - Flask-based application for easy accessibility.
